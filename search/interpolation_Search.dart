/* By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining
 * search space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison
 * between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought. The remaining
 * search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position.
 * The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start, ignoring any sorting.
 * On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements
 * are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case
 * (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.
 * In interpolation-sequential search, interpolation is used to find an item near the one being searched for,
 * then linear search is used to find the exact item. */
